# Sorting Algorithms Overview

## Key points to remember for interviews:

### Time Complexities
- Quick Sort: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst
- Merge Sort: O(n log n) always
- Insertion Sort: O(n²)
- Selection Sort: O(n²)
- Bubble Sort: O(n²)

### Space Complexities
- Quick Sort: O(log n)
- Merge Sort: O(n)
- Insertion Sort: O(1)
- Selection Sort: O(1)
- Bubble Sort: O(1)

### When to Use Each
- Quick Sort: Best general-purpose sorting algorithm
- Merge Sort: When stable sort is needed and memory is not a concern
- Insertion Sort: Small arrays or nearly sorted data
- Selection Sort: Small arrays or when memory writes are expensive
- Bubble Sort: Rarely used in practice, mainly educational

### Interview Tips
- Know how to implement Quick Sort and Merge Sort by heart
- Understand the trade-offs between different algorithms
- Be able to explain why certain algorithms are better in specific scenarios
- Know how to handle edge cases (empty arrays, single elements, duplicates)
- Be prepared to optimize for specific requirements (memory constraints, stability needs)
